# Mission-to-Mars
A web application is built which will scrape new data every time when the button is clicked using python script.

## Overview of the Analysis
Webscraping is a method of gathering data from different sources quickly instead of visiting each website ourself and manually extracting the data.To extract the information from active websites we need Chrome developer tools,which identifies the html components attached to the data we want.The webscraping is automated using Beautiful Soup and Splinter,which automates the web browser and gathers the data we have identified.After extracting the data,the collected data is stored in MongoDB,which is NO SQL database.It can handle unstructures,messy data,data without relationships to other data.MongoDB uses Document model,that means data is stored in JSON data structure.Its fast and efficient.
To show off the analysitcs we will be using Web application framework called Flask.To enhance the webpage we will be using Bootstrap,a useful and easy HTML and CSS framework.

## Purpose of the Analysis
In this analysis,we would help Robin,a data analyst who wants to gather data about the mission to mars from all the websites and display it in central location without spending the time for gathering the data manually.she wants to collect the information about Mars like Mars latest news,headings,Mars table information,Images.The collected information is stored in MongoDB and the information is displayed in a web page using FLask framework.

## Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

For scraping the information we need to visit the website in our browser,using Dev Tools we need to inspect the page and proper HTML elements are extracted to scrape.In order to extract the image URLS and title we need to use Splinter and Beautiful Soup tools,we need to retrieve the url image and title and add to the list and the list contains dictionary of image URLS and titles.In the module,we have already collected the mars heading,content,featured images and table information from different websites which are mentioned below.
|   ***Mars Title and Paragraph***   | ***Mars Featured Images***   |***Mars Facts***   |
|  ----------------------------------|  -----------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------|
|  <img src = "https://github.com/fathi129/Mission-to-Mars/blob/master/Screenshots%20for%20Mission%20to%20mars/nasatitle.png" width = 350><br >   | <img src = "https://github.com/fathi129/Mission-to-Mars/blob/master/Screenshots%20for%20Mission%20to%20mars/nasaimg.png" width = 350><br> |<img src = "https://github.com/fathi129/Mission-to-Mars/blob/master/Screenshots%20for%20Mission%20to%20mars/mars_facts.png" width = 350><br > | <br>

The mission to mars our web page looks like this with the collected information.<br>
<img src = "https://github.com/fathi129/Mission-to-Mars/blob/master/Screenshots%20for%20Mission%20to%20mars/deliverable%201.png" width = 350><br > 
The collected image urls and title list looks like this <br>
 <img src = "https://github.com/fathi129/Mission-to-Mars/blob/master/Screenshots%20for%20Mission%20to%20mars/hemisphere_urls.png" width = 700><br >
From the source website we collected teh images and titles and stored in out web page.
               
## Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Marsâ€™s Hemisphere Images and Titles

Using the Python and HTML skills, we will add the code we created previously in our scraping.py file, update our Mongo database, and modify our index.html file so the webpage contains all the information we collected in the module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
In the def scrape_all() function in our scraping.py file, created a new dictionary in the data dictionary to hold a list of dictionaries with the URL string and title of each hemisphere image.A function that will scrape the hemisphere data by using our code from deliverable 1. At the end of the function, return the scraped data as a list of dictionaries with the URL string and title of each hemisphere image.
Run the app.py file in VScode, then when we check our Mongo database to make sure all the data are retrieved and stored.
we need to Modify the index.html file to access our database, and retrieve the img_url and title as we loop through the dictionary in the database.
From the source website we collected teh images and titles and stored in out web page.<br>

|   ***Mars Hemisphere Source WebPage***   | ***Mars Hemispheres***     |
|  ----------------------------------|  ----------------------------- | 
|  <img src = "https://github.com/fathi129/Mission-to-Mars/blob/master/Screenshots%20for%20Mission%20to%20mars/mars_hemp.png" width = 350><br >   | <img src = "https://github.com/fathi129/Mission-to-Mars/blob/master/Screenshots%20for%20Mission%20to%20mars/MarsHemisphere.png" width = 350><br> | <br>

The final web page looks like this <br> 
<img src = "https://github.com/fathi129/Mission-to-Mars/blob/master/Screenshots%20for%20Mission%20to%20mars/Fullpage.png" width = 600><br> 

## Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components 

When we check the web page using our Bootstrap 3 grid system,the web page is mobile-responsive.Using dev tools the responsiveness of the website is checked.Clicked on the Toggle Device Toolbar icon to open the UI that enables us to simulate responsiveness.
Choose various mobile devices to test the webpage, as shown in the following image:<br>
<img src = "https://github.com/fathi129/Mission-to-Mars/blob/master/Screenshots%20for%20Mission%20to%20mars/Bootsrap_Responsiveness.png" width = 600><br> 
For further adding adding bootstrap components in the web page used the following:
- Changed the color of  Scrape New Data button to red color.Changed the background color of the container and jumbotron class.
- Tool tip has been added under the button which gives the information what we have to do.Added the page header class,which gives horizontal line to the text.<br>

- Added alert success class with alert dismissible feature which allows us to close the box. Enhanced the features of the table by adding the classes table-striped,table-hover.The Paragraph content has been enhanced by using the class lead.
-For the images,the grid layouts has been applied,Get four equal-width columns starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops by using `.col-md-3`. which are thumbnailed using the class thumbnail.<br>
